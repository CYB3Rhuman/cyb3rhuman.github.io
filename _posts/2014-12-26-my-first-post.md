title: My first post

I started this little blog today. I will keep my posts neat and short because I'm too lazy even to write some comments for my code. I don't yet know what this blog is going to be about: maybe my software, maybe my hardware, maybe something else (most probably it would be just about nothing).

Also sorry for my bad English, it is not my native language, but I will try to only write in English here.

This is not my first attempt to start blogging, but none of my old blogs survived. Here is a new one, let's see if it survives!
