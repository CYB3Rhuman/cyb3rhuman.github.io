title: My first post

I started this little blog today. I will keep my posts neat and short because I'm too lazy even to write some comments for my code. I don't yet know what this blog is going to be about: maybe my software, maybe my hardware, maybe something else (most probably it would be just about nothing).

This is not my first attempt to start blogging, but node of my old blogs survided. Here is a new one, let's see if it survives!
